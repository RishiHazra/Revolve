class HumanoidEnv(MujocoEnv, utils.EzPickle):
    """
    ## Description

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (17,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space
    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the
    positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso. These may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (378,), float64)` where the first two observations
    represent the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates
    will be returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (376,), float64)`. The elements correspond to the following:

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
    the observation contains (in order):
    - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of mass
    (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10 (*nbody * 10*)
    and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
    - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence
    adds another 84 elements in the state space
    - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has shape
    `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state space.
    - *cfrc_ext:* This is the center of mass based external force on the body.  It has shape
    14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 84 elements in the state space.
    where *nbody* stands for the number of bodies in the robot and *nv* stands for the
    number of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*)

    The body parts are:

    ## Episode End
    The humanoid is said to be unhealthy if the z-position of the torso is no longer contained in the
    closed interval specified by the argument `healthy_z_range`.

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=True` is passed during construction (which is the default),
    the episode ends when any of the following happens:

    1. Truncation: The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
    3. Termination: The humanoid is unhealthy

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=False` is passed, the episode is ended only when 1000 timesteps are exceeded.
